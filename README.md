## What is it?

This is my big study plan for going from simple programmer dude to software engineer who can understand how autonomous drones work.

There are references and video of various popular open source flight controller firmware and guidance projects in order to give the reader a sense of realism and real-sense and real-world value of operations, as well as act as get-to-know-the-market info.

![Skydio's SLAM](https://pbs.twimg.com/ext_tw_video_thumb/976148551779500032/pu/img/erxg20ZxAfOoDBKb.jpg)

This is meant for **software engineers** or people who already know how to code and also got basic knowledge of computer science topics including math __(probablility, calculus, linear algebra)__. If you have many years of experience this can be easier to read through, but this is not guaranteed.

Disclaimer: I am not employed nor have I got any work experience on commerial or research rotorcraft.

## Why use it?

When I started this project, I didn't know how a drone could see, how the math behind the control
algorithm worked, what the limitations are or anything like that.
I started skimming through any resources I could after being inspired by the newly released
[Skydio r1](https://www.skydio.com/) and it's CEO's [numerous guest lectures at youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI66eq7Nn1E). I slowly started building enough sensors to be able to grasp every sub-component of such flying systems. I have not learned everything yet, but the list is big enough to share and will always be evolving with more stuff added.

It's a long plan. It may take you months. If you are familiar with a lot of this already it will take you a lot less time.

## How to use it

Everything below is an outline, and you should tackle the items in order from top to bottom.

I'm using Github's special markdown flavor, including tasks lists to check progress.

**Create a new branch so you can check items like this, just put an x in the brackets: [x]**

    Fork a branch and follow the commands below

`git checkout -b progress`

`git remote add zarkopafilis https://github.com/zarkopafilis/awesome-dronecraft`

`git fetch --all`

    Mark all boxes with X after you completed your changes

`git add .`

`git commit -m "Marked x"`

`git rebase zarkopafilis/master`

`git push --force`

## Don't feel you aren't smart enough

- Successful software engineers are smart, but many have an insecurity that they aren't smart enough.
- [The myth of the Genius Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SARbwvhupQ)
- [It's Dangerous to Go Alone: Battling the Invisible Monsters in Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i8ylq4j_EY)
- [Believe you can change](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/dweck)
- [Think you're not smart enough to work at Google? Well, think again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPOJ1PR50ag)

## You can't pick only one language

You can't use only 1 language you are comfortable in to do the coding of the drones. You'd have to rely on many tools. Here are some for example.

- C++
- C
- Python
- Matlab (Yes, I know)

You may also need to learn a bit of other tools in the proccess. This is NOT something that you should feel worried about. With studying consistency there is nothing you can't achieve!

## Book List

- [Quan, Quan - Introduction to Multicopter Design and Control](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9789811033810)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A very good all-around book. It provides a more than quick-overview on all the different topics regarding quadcopters, from frame design, to electronics and control, diving deep enough on technical and practical design practises and considerations. It provides intuition behind every subject matter and does not containt ambiguities. The mathematics may seem too hard to deal with for some people, but that's not a thing to worry about. A person without mechanical or electrical engineering background can easily tackle this with some calculus and basic geometry knowledge.

## Before you Get Started

This list grew over many months, and yes, it kind of got out of hand.

Here are some mistakes I made so you'll have a better experience.

### You can't take it all in at once

Take breaks, write down possible things you need to re-review and watch them later or in a different way. This is a lot to take in and breaks are mandatory.

Some concepts can take much longer to understand fully. So if you don't understand it immediately do not worry. I suggest re-studying some of the parts that seemed hard to you after doing one pass on this study list.

### Focus

There are a lot of distractions that can take up valuable time. Focus and concentration are hard.

## What you won't see covered

- Don't know yet

## Prerequisite Knowledge

Learn to code. This is only required for you to understand how the different algorithms and techniques that will be presented are actually implemented. You need this knowledge to be able to understand the source code of the popular data structure implementations, open source flight controllers and more. Basic data structure and algorithmic complexity should be included.

- [x] **C, C++, Python, Anything**
    - Information available on the internet is widely available and you can find lot's of stuff by googling.
    - I could recommend to start with Python and work your way down to C and C++.
    - You can learn to code in parallel with this study plan, but things will be a lot harder and will take more time.
    - [ ] [A complete computer science study plan to become a software engineer](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university)

The next part is needed to be able to understand the math behind the stuff we are going to use. It's not at all harder compared to other fields of study. Hang on and in the end, you'll be surprised by how easy it is to understand everything. This is not the only path to learn these, it's just what I would take. (Yes, I like university lectures and whitepapers.)

## Simulation and Control

- This is the basis of rotorcraft that is going to get covered first. These few resources will make you understand what a drone needs to fly bad, good, with the help of extra autonomy engines or with the help of a pilot.
- After this part, the corks and screws of each subsystem is going to be investigated thoroughly.

__At this point, you might wonder: This is only for four rotors. Don't worry, the extra ones are only used to have resilience. In the future this is going to be populated with more types of rotorcraft like submarines, VTOL drones and wings.__



## Control Theory

- Now that you have got a rough understanding of how you are going to make things fly, it's time to take a better look into the mathematical concepts behind the control of systems.

## Building a Racing FPV Quadcopter

- In order to do that, you have to find a set of required hardware that is compatible, burn and configure your desired flight controller firmware.

- [ ] **Minimum Hardware**
    - [ ] Frame. For racing/fully manual control, typically carbon fiber, but you can even 3d print one or carve one out of wood. Take 2 dimensions in mind: flight controller stack size and propeller size. Most common propellers would be about 5".
    - [ ] Flight Controller. You know enough to choose one. I'd use betaflight.
    - [ ] ESCs. You can go with a 4 x 1 ESC or All in one board combo. Each has got advantages and disadvantages, search about it. But first, check your battery. It should be able to handle the burst current.
    - [ ] PDB. You need a power distribution board. These are relatively small and uncomplicated. You can find __PDB+ESC+FC__ all in one combos that include battery step down and all that. But first, check your battery.
    - [ ] Battery. LiPo. At the time of this writing you can go from 4s to 6s. Price depends on capacity, discharge rating and cell count.
    - [ ] Brushless Motors. You know, to make the thing move.
    - [ ] RC Transceiver. Should be compatible with your RC Controller and it's protocol should be compatible with your FC board. Typically 2.4GHz.
    - [ ] RC Controller. Flysky, Taranis, there are too many to list.
    - After configuring frameware you should be able to fly this, but there are several stuff missing.
- [ ] **Optional Hardware**
    - [ ] Camera. Not the kind you are used to. This one sends out (analog) PAL/VTSC video and should support [OSD](https://oscarliang.com/betaflight-osd/)
    - [ ] VTX. Stands for video transmitter. This is used to broadcast the video to typically 5.8GHz. Research how much mW you need.
    - [ ] FPV Goggles. To view the video. Should bear compatible antenna with the VTX. Diversity modules which dynamically choose the best signal source from an omnidirectional and a directional antenna are better.
    - [ ] Aftermarket Antennas. For beter reception.
    - [ ] Beeper. Beeps if you lose it.
    - [ ] Battery Balance Charger. You can't use discharged batteries.
    - [ ] Battery Balance Charger Power Supply. If your charger does not come with one. (Most IMAX B6s do not, for example)
    - [ ] 3D Printed GoPro Session Case
    - [ ] Insulation Tape
    - [ ] Zipties
    - [ ] LEDs for the bottom of the craft
    - [ ] Velcro Battery Straps

- [ ] **Software and Further Configuration**
    - [ ] Blackbox Logging. Important information regarding your flight. Can help you out for post-flight analysis.
    - [ ] RC Channel Mapping
    - [ ] Make sure that ESCs spin in the correct directions. You can change this in the ESC software or flight controller software.
    - [ ] Pair RC Transceiver with your RC Controller.
    - [ ] PID and Rates Tuning
    - [ ] Keep a configuration backup along with the exact firmware number so you don't forget.

__Experienced racing pilots recommend that you stard by flying 'acro'/'freestyle' mode straight from the start. Do not do that with real drone hardware, the probability of crashing within 2 seconds is almost 100%. Take your time on a simulator first. There are many ones that you can find on the most popular gaming platforms like Steam. For example: Liftoff, DRL Sim, etc...__

__Flying 'angle'/'aided' mode is much easier and the same to flying your typical DJI/Parrot/etc drone around. You can fly this 'line of sight' even if you dont have goggles.__

## Building Fully Autonomous Rotorcraft

- Building Fully Autonomous Rotorcraft is much harder and more resource intensive than building a computer-aided one. You need to do better calibration because there is no pilot directly flying it-only supervising it.

- **Basic Hardware**. Basic in the sense that you need at least those for this to fly autonomously. You could maybe leave the GPS out of that, but you need at least optical flow for exact stabilization.
    - [ ] Flight Controller. Prefer a pre-tuned pre-built one that's resilient and robust enough. The [Pixhawk 4](https://docs.px4.io/master/en/flight_controller/pixhawk4.html) is a very good option, with dual IMUs, a ton of sensors, standarized connectors and a ton of connectivity options.
    - [ ] GPS
    - [ ] and/or Bottom Mounted Camera(s). Example of a drone that has got cameras on the bottom but no GPS, is the one from the matlab tech talks.
    - [ ] Frame
    - [ ] Propellers
    - [ ] Brushless Motors
    - [ ] Power Distribution Board
    - [ ] LiPo Battery
    - [ ] Connectivity
        - [ ] Some way to send mission control data and receive information
        - [ ] RC Controller to pilot-override the trajectory

- [ ] **Optional Hardware**
    - **Basic Obstacle Avoidance**
        - [ ] Front Mounted Camera (or RGB-D or long range ultrasonic for slow moving drones)
        - [ ] Basic Co-Processor if the flight controller firmware can't handle obstacle avoidance on it's own
    - **Auto Land and Hand Land**
        - [ ] Bottom mounted ultrasonic sensor
        - [ ] and/or bottom mounted camera(s) -- two cameras needed for depth in order to be more reliable than optical flow
    - **Payload Carry**
        - [ ] Some kind of [magnet](https://kb.zubax.com/display/MAINKB/OpenGrab+EPM+v3) or servo to drop payloads
    - **Advanced Camera Ops**
        - [ ] Rotating Gimbal. In order not to couple the field of view along with the movement of the drone.
        - [ ] RGB-D Camera (for better SLAM)
        - [ ] LiDAR (SLAM too)
    - [ ] Retracting Landing Gear
    - **Extra Connectivity**
        - [ ] WiFi
        - [ ] LoRa
        - [ ] E-3G-4G-5G

Congratulations!

Keep learning.

You're never really done. But still, good job :).
